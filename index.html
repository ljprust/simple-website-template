              Hello! I am a theoretical astrophysicist interested in astrophysical fluids and how they 
              can be modeled by numerical hydrodynamics. I particularly focus on stellar interactions, 
              as they provide an avenue to study unsolved phenomena such as the formation of black hole 
              binaries. I'm an active developer of the moving-mesh code

            <h2>Common Envelope Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              Common envelope evolution (CEE) is a phase in the life of a binary star system in which a giant star shares its gaseous 
              envelope with a small companion object, such as a main sequence star or white dwarf. This process plays a role in 
              the formation of many objects of interest to astronomers, including:
              <ul>
                <li>double white dwarfs</li>
                <li>X-ray binaries</li>
                <li>binary neutron stars</li>
                <li>binary black holes</li>
                <li>progenitors of type Ia supernovae</li>
                <li>planetary nebulae</li>
              </ul>
              Direct observations of CEE are scarce, and paper-and-pencil calculations are hampered 
              by the many types of physical processes which must be taken into consideration: convection, accretion, radiation, self-gravity, 
              recombination, and magnetism, among others. Luckily, 3-D hydrodynamics comes to the rescue!

              We carry out simulations of the common envelope phase using the moving-mesh code 
              <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.471.3577C/abstract">MANGA</a>, with the goal of determining  
              the efficiency with which the envelope is ejected and to find a mapping from the initial state of the binary to 
              its final separation. The stellar evolution code <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.11.1/">MESA</a> is used 
              both to determine the initial structure of the giant and to provide an equation of state for the gas.

            <p>
              Similar to common envelope evolution, it is also possible for a post-main sequence star ascending the giant branch to engulf 
              one or more of its inner planets. 
              The planet spirals into the giant due to drag, ultimately leading to its destruction and a temporary increase in the size and luminosity of the giant. 
              We use the adaptive mesh refinement code 
              <a href="https://www.athena-astro.app/">Athena++</a> to perform "wind-tunnel" simulations of the interaction between the planet and surrounding envelope.

           <p>
             The flow around an engulfed planet depends largely on the ability of its gravitational pull to accrete stellar material 
             against the immense ram pressure from the oncoming fluid. 
             When the planet is in the outer envelope, gravity is strong enough to cloak the planet in a pseudo-hydrostatic halo of gas adorned by a bow shock. 
             But as it spirals in and speeds up, this halo is gradually stripped off and the bow shock moves inward toward the planet surface until an abrupt transition takes place. 
             Here a recompression shock forms behind the planet, deflecting the flow outward and creating a low-density separation bubble behind the planet. 
             We find that these two distinct morphologies are also described by different models for the drag experienced by the planet due to both ram pressure and dynamical friction.

            <h2>Supernova Remnants</h2>
            <p>
              When a star goes supernova, it launches ejecta which shocks the surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM). 
              Once the forward shock has swept up a significant amount of mass, a reverse shock travels backward though the ejecta. 
              The shell of material between these shocks experiences Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, creating turbulence which leads to synchrotron emission in the radio band. 
              If the star lost mass prior to its supernova (through winds, binary interactions, 
              or other means), the CSM will be overdense, which we can implicitly measure with radio observations. One such supernova is SN 1993J, a red 
              supergiant which lost almost its entire hydrogen envelope prior to exploding.

            <p>
              The 30 years of observational data on SN 1993J can be compared to numerical models to better understand the structure of the CSM,
              and thus the mechanism of mass loss. To this end, we use 1-D hydrodynamics to track the evolution of the remnant with various CSM models. 
              Though Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities are inherently absent in one-dimensional calculations, 3-D models have been used to train the moving-mesh code 
              <a href="https://github.com/duffell/RT1D">RT1D</a> on how the instability will manifest in 1-D.

            <h2>Bondi-Hoyle Accretion</h2>
            <p>
              Objects moving though a gaseous medium accrete matter from their surroundings, 
              and knowledge of the accretion rate is important for understanding the growth and dynamics of a variety of objects.
              The rates for static or highly-supersonic accretors are well-known, whereas for intermediate velocities 
              we are left with interpolations between these known solutions. 
              We study accretion at such velocities using the adaptive mesh refinement code 
              <a href="https://www.athena-astro.app/">Athena++</a> and the moving-mesh code 
              <a href="https://arepo-code.org/">Arepo</a>.
            </p>
            <center>
              <figure>
                <img src="kinetic00010.png" alt="axisymmetric accretion" width="500" height="auto">
                <!--<figcaption> Axisymmetric accretion onto a compact object in <a href="https://www.athena-astro.app/">Athena++</a>. </figcaption>-->
              </figure>
            </center>
            <p>
              We find that moving accretors which are small relative to their sphere of gravitational influence (e.g. black holes), 
              deflection of the flow due to gravity and pressure gradients ensure that 
              the streamlines entering the accretor are essentially radial. Thus, the accreton rate is equal to that of a static accretor, 
              depending only on the entropy of the accreted gas. This has the surprising consequence that the rate is 
              independent of Mach number for black holes which are moving subsonically. For supersonic motion, shock waves are present which 
              raise the gas entropy, lowering the accretion rate.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Magnetohydrodynamics</h2>
            <p>
              Magnetism is important in many areas of astrophysics, such as in the dynamics of accretion disks and the 
              formation of jets. Often the magnetic field can be treated as "frozen into" the fluid, 
              so that the fluid motion causes the field lines to twist and turn. 
              The presence of the field also introduces new types of wave motion in the fluid, such as magnetosonic and Alfven waves.
            </p>

            </figure>
            </center>
            <p>
              Magnetism can be implemented into hydrodynamic solvers by simply adding a few terms into the governing equations. However, numerical 
              noise can lead to the formation of magnetic monopoles, violating Gauss's law of magnetism. I work on developing techniques to 
              combat these monopoles by either damping them or smoothing them out.
            </p>
            <p>
              As mentioned above, magnetism is thought to play a role in common envelope evolution. Though not dynamically important over small 
              timescales, magnetic pressure can shape the ejecta from a CE event over the course of many years. This phenomenon is thought to 
              be responsible for the bipolar plumes of the Calabash Nebula, which are observed to be threaded by magnetic fields. 
              Our magnetohydrodynamic solvers have shown the formation of the toroidal magnetic fields thought to drive these outflows.

            <h2>Simulation Techniques</h2>
            <p>
              When solving the hydrodynamic equations, there are two schools of thought, each of which has inherent strengths and weaknesses. 
              The Lagrangian interpretation models the fluid as a collection of particles, while the Eulerian interpretation divides 
              the space into a mesh. The moving-mesh method has been developed with the goal of combining the strengths of both. This method 
              draws a dynamic mesh around a set of moving particles, leveraging the superior shock capturing and spatial resolution of Eulerian 
              methods while avoiding grid effects such as preferred axes and difficulties with bulk advection. The use of a Voronoi tessellation 
              provides a deformable mesh.

            </center>
            <p>
              I am interested in the development of moving-mesh techniques and their application to astrophysics. Despite their high 
              computational cost, moving meshes are well-suited to a variety of problems.
              For example, the presence of an inner boundary condition such as a reflection or accretion boundary is desirable for a variety of studies. 
              The use of a moving mesh allows us to construct a boundary which moves throughout the simulation domain, possibly in response to 
              gravitational or hydrodynamic forces.
